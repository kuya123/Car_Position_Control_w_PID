# Car_Position_Control_w_PID
The purpose of the whole project is to demonstrate the study and usage of classic PID. I will model and simulate a car position control in octave.   then a real control system in Arduino will be created.


# File list

### drawing
proj_PID_draw_simple_car.m --- draw a rectangle car image 
proj_PID_draw_simple_car_horizontal_movement.m --- test above function by creating a dynamic cartoon.

### model 
proj_PID_car_ODE_model.m --- an ODE function model to discribe car movement 

### simulation
proj_PID_compare_ODE_and_TransferFunc.m --- compare the transient simulation between our ODE model and corresponding transfer function model
