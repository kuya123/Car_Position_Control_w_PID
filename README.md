# Car_Position_Control_w_PID
The purpose of the whole project is to demonstrate the study and usage of classic PID. I will model and simulate a car position control in octave.   then a real control system in Arduino will be created.

# Two major sections
### Transfer function PID
in this section , I will control a small car's position with classic PID control loop. All analysis will be done with TF. 

### State Space PID
in this section , I will control a inverted pendulum car.  I will send the location target to the system and the car will move to the place with pendulum in balance shape. 


# File list 

### Octave Analysis folder
anyway, I like Octave and thus I have to use it as a Matlab substitution.  here I build model and run simulation to verify my idea. 

### Arduino HW folder
and I like LEGO, especially the flexibilty it provides. thus I build my small car and Inverted Pendulum car with LEGO.  in this folder, I put my firmware and HW info

### Results folder
I plan to consolidate all analysis data and vedio here, if my result is perfect.    em.... maybe it can be useful when I become old and forget everything I have done in my young age. 

enjoy building , enjoy coding and enjoy life

Cheers
