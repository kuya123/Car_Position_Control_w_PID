Project update and thinking notes. 

2020.10.25 ~ 26

build up my dear car twice.  I used sonar radar to detect distance.  after some testing, the sonar responce is quite accurate and fast, great.  I can get everything updated less than 3ms.  good.

my PWM driver is running now.   PWM period can be as short as 500uS.   but the problem, I found during testing, is that shorter PWM period will require higher dutycycle to turn motor on.   thus to make a balance between period update for PID loop, Sonar distance sampling and PWM period, I still prefer PWM period set to around 2mS. 


2020.10.27 update

today I implemented PID loop on the system and it can follow command to make target-location movement.  the system is not accurate yet, but at least it runs up.  hello world. 


2020.10.28 update

1. the TT motor has low torque and it has difficulty to make any movement at low dutycycle PWM. thus I changed PID output value mapping machenicsm to make the PID output range from -90% to 90% with an additional 10% offset for its final driven number. It works and now 10% is the smalleast duty for my motor. 

2. I have implement dynamic Kp/Ki/Kd changing.  aggressive number are used when distance > 300, and conservative number are used for distance difference < 150.  it works. 

3. due to low torque from TT motor, the car movement is not so swift.  thus I decide to try some new high torque motor. after searching I locate 370 motor, which can provide abt 0.8kgcm torque value.  I will try it later and hope I can get a faster responce. 

4. my Kd derivative control in PID loop doesn't show out correct behavior, i need to check it out.
